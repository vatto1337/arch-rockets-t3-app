## What I Would Have Improved if I Had More Time

I feel that I have done a great job with this project within a strict 4-hour limit. However, there are a few areas that I believe could have been improved:

- Adding more content to the pages; I find the homepage too brief with only a few blocks.
- Making the app resilient to scenarios where the API might not function. Currently, I am only following a happy path approach. In a live environment, I would ensure error handling and robustness.
- Optimizing images further.
- Setting up a proper theme pallete etc.

## How Do I Run This?

To run this project:

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
2. Run `npm run dev` to start the development environment.
